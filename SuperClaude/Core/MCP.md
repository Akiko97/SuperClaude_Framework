# MCP.md - SuperClaude MCP Server Reference

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration and orchestration system for Claude Code SuperClaude framework.

## Server Selection Algorithm

**Priority Matrix**:
1. Task-Server Affinity: Match tasks to optimal servers based on capability matrix
2. Performance Metrics: Server response time, success rate, resource utilization
3. Context Awareness: Current persona, command depth, session state
4. Load Distribution: Prevent server overload through intelligent queuing
5. Fallback Readiness: Maintain backup servers for critical operations

**Selection Process**: Task Analysis → Server Capability Match → Performance Check → Load Assessment → Final Selection

## Context7 Integration (Documentation & Research)

**Purpose**: Official library documentation, code examples, best practices, localization standards

**Connection Details**:
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.context7.com/v1`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token via `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Timeout**: 5000ms
- **Fallback**: Internal `superclaude-code` server for basic documentation

**Activation Patterns**: 
- Automatic: External library imports detected, framework-specific questions, scribe persona active
- Manual: `--c7`, `--context7` flags
- Smart: Commands detect need for official documentation patterns

**Workflow Process**:
1. Library Detection: Scan imports, dependencies, package.json for library references
2. ID Resolution: Use `resolve-library-id` to find Context7-compatible library ID
3. Documentation Retrieval: Call `get-library-docs` with specific topic focus
4. Pattern Extraction: Extract relevant code patterns and implementation examples
5. Implementation: Apply patterns with proper attribution and version compatibility
6. Validation: Verify implementation against official documentation
7. Caching: Store successful patterns for session reuse

**Integration Commands**: `/build`, `/analyze`, `/improve`, `/review`, `/design`, `/dev-setup`, `/document`, `/explain`, `/git`

**Error Recovery**:
- Library not found → WebSearch for alternatives → Manual implementation
- Documentation timeout → Use cached knowledge → Note limitations

- Version mismatch → Find compatible version → Suggest upgrade path
- Server unavailable → Activate backup Context7 instances → Graceful degradation

**Integration Patterns**:
- Minimal Start: Start with minimal MCP usage and expand based on needs
- Progressive Enhancement: Progressively enhance with additional servers
- Result Combination: Combine MCP results for comprehensive solutions
- Graceful Fallback: Fallback gracefully when servers unavailable
- Loop Integration: Sequential for iterative analysis, Context7 for improvement patterns
- Dependency Orchestration: Manage inter-server dependencies and data flow

## External Server Configuration

**Configuration File**: `/home/anton/SuperClaude_MCP/MCP_Servers/mcp-servers.json`

**Environment Variables Required**:
```bash
CONTEXT7_API_KEY=your-context7-api-key
SEQUENTIAL_TOKEN=your-sequential-token
MAGIC_API_KEY=your-magic-api-key
BRIDGE_HOOKS_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

**Health Monitoring**:
- Health checks every 30 seconds
- Circuit breaker opens after 5 consecutive failures
- Auto-recovery after 60 seconds
- Fallback to internal servers when external unavailable

**Performance Targets**:
- External server response: <500ms p95
- Circuit breaker decision: <10ms
- Fallback activation: <100ms
- End-to-end with external: <1s

## Troubleshooting External Servers

### Context7 Connection Issues
1. Verify API key is set: `echo $CONTEXT7_API_KEY`
2. Test connection: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTEXT7_API_KEY" https://api.context7.com/v1/health`
3. Check firewall rules for HTTPS outbound
4. Monitor circuit breaker status in bridge logs

### Sequential WebSocket Issues
1. Ensure WebSocket support in network
2. Try HTTP fallback mode if WebSocket fails
3. Check token expiration
4. Verify endpoint accessibility

### Magic API Issues
1. Validate API key format
2. Check rate limits (usually 100 req/min)
3. Monitor response times
4. Use fallback for basic components

### Playwright Local Issues
1. Install Playwright: `npx playwright install`
2. Check executable permissions
3. Verify browser dependencies
4. Use remote mode for containers

## Hybrid Operation Mode

**Intelligent Routing**: System automatically routes to best available server
- Priority 1: External server if available and healthy
- Priority 2: Internal server with similar capabilities
- Priority 3: Orchestrator server as universal fallback

**Performance Optimization**:
- Cache external server responses for 5 minutes
- Batch requests when possible
- Use predictive routing based on patterns
- Pre-warm connections during idle time
