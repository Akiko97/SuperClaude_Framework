# SuperClaude Framework Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development path for SuperClaude Framework. All timelines are estimates and may change based on community needs and contributions.

## 🎯 Current Focus (v3.0.x)

### Stability & Testing
- **Comprehensive test coverage** for all 15 hooks
- **Performance benchmarking** suite with automated CI/CD
- **Documentation improvements** based on user feedback
- **Bug fixes** and stability improvements

### Developer Experience
- **Installation wizard** with feature selection
- **Better error messages** and debugging tools
- **Development mode** improvements for contributors
- **Examples and tutorials** for common use cases

## 🚀 Near-term Goals (v3.1 - Q4 2025)

### Enhanced Modularity

- **MCP server marketplace** for easy discovery and installation
- **Server health monitoring** and automatic failover
- **Custom MCP server templates** for rapid development

### Enterprise Features
- **Team collaboration** features with shared configurations
- **Audit logging** and compliance reporting
- **Role-based access controls** for different team members
- **Integration with enterprise development workflows**

### Framework Ecosystem
- **IDE integrations** beyond Claude Code
- **CI/CD pipeline hooks** for automated quality gates
- **Monitoring dashboard** for team performance metrics
- **API for external tool integration**

## 🌟 Long-term Aspirations (v4.0+ - 2026+)

### Next-Generation Architecture
- **Distributed hook execution** across multiple environments
- **Cloud-native deployment** options for enterprise teams
- **Real-time collaboration** features for distributed development
