# Leveraging Hooks to Enhance SuperClaude

## 🚀 Overview

This document outlines how Claude Code's hooks system can be integrated with the SuperClaude framework to create a more adaptive, intelligent, and user-configurable AI development assistant.

## 🔄 Understanding Hooks in Claude Code

**Hooks are user-defined shell commands** that execute automatically at specific points during Claude Code's operation. They provide deterministic control over Claude's behavior and run with full user permissions.

### Key Events Where Hooks Execute:
- **PreToolUse**: Before any tool is called
- **PostToolUse**: After a tool completes
- **Notification**: When Claude needs permission
- **Stop**: When the main agent finishes
- **SubagentStop**: When a subagent completes
- **PreCompact**: Before context compaction

### Common Use Cases:
- 🔔 Notifications when input is needed
- 🎨 Automatic code formatting
- 📊 Command logging and auditing
- ✅ Enforcing code conventions
- 🔒 Custom permission controls

## 💡 Integration Strategies

### 1. **Quality Gate Integration**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "superclaude-quality-gate --step pre-edit --validate"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```
- 🔍 Framework Compliance: Enforce SuperClaude's 8-step validation cycle
- 📊 Pattern Recognition: Track which quality gates fail most frequently
- 🎯 Self-Assessment: Adjust validation strictness based on project phase

### 2. **Persona Decision Logging**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Log persona activations for meta-learning
echo "$(date): $PERSONA_ACTIVATED for $TASK_TYPE" >> ~/.superclaude/persona-log.json
```
- 🧠 Reasoning Analysis: Build persona effectiveness metrics
- 📈 Pattern Recognition: Learn which personas work best for specific codebases
- 🔄 Action Sequence: Auto-tune persona activation thresholds

### 3. **Wave Orchestration Checkpoints**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "TodoWrite",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "superclaude-wave-checkpoint --validate-progress"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```
- 🌊 Wave Validation: Ensure each wave meets quality criteria before proceeding
- 🔄 Progressive Enhancement: Capture intermediate results for rollback
- 📊 Performance Tracking: Measure wave effectiveness metrics

### 4. **Resource Management Alerts**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Alert when entering resource danger zones
if [ "$TOKEN_USAGE" -gt 75 ]; then
  notify-send "SuperClaude: Entering Orange Zone - Compression recommended"
  echo '{"action": "suggest", "flags": ["--uc", "--safe-mode"]}'
fi
```
- 🚨 Proactive Monitoring: Alert before hitting critical thresholds
- ⚡ Performance Optimization: Auto-suggest efficiency modes
- 🛡️ Safety Protocols: Prevent resource exhaustion

### 5. **MCP Server Health Monitoring**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "mcp__.*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "check-mcp-health --server $MCP_SERVER --fallback-ready"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```
- 🔍 Framework Compliance: Ensure MCP servers are responsive
- 🔄 Fallback Activation: Automatically switch to backup servers
- 📊 Performance Metrics: Track server reliability over time

### 6. **Project-Specific Learning System**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Capture successful patterns for reuse
cat > ~/.superclaude/project-patterns.json << EOF
{
  "pattern": "$OPERATION_TYPE",
  "success": true,
  "persona": "$ACTIVE_PERSONA",
  "flags": "$ACTIVE_FLAGS",
  "performance": "$EXECUTION_TIME"
}
EOF
```
- 💡 Meta-Learning: Build project-specific optimization database
- 🎯 Pattern Matching: Improve routing decisions based on history
- 📈 Continuous Improvement: Refine SuperClaude for each codebase

### 7. **Compliance and Audit Trail**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "generate-superclaude-report --session $SESSION_ID --metrics --decisions"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```
- 📊 Evidence Generation: Create comprehensive session reports
- 🔍 Decision Transparency: Document why specific paths were taken
- ✅ Compliance Tracking: Ensure adherence to organizational policies

## 🔑 Key Benefits

1. **Adaptive Intelligence**: Hooks create feedback loops that help SuperClaude learn project-specific patterns
2. **Deterministic Control**: Users can enforce policies that override AI decisions when necessary
3. **Observability**: Real-time monitoring of SuperClaude's decision-making process
4. **Quality Assurance**: Additional validation layers beyond built-in quality gates
5. **Custom Workflows**: Project-specific automation that enhances SuperClaude's capabilities

## 🎯 Implementation Considerations

### Security Best Practices
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use absolute paths in scripts
- Quote shell variables properly
- Avoid modifying sensitive files
- Run hooks with minimal required permissions

### Performance Optimization
- Keep hook scripts lightweight and fast
- Use async operations where possible
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Monitor hook execution times
- Implement timeout mechanisms

### Error Handling
- Always provide meaningful exit codes
- Log errors to dedicated files
- Implement graceful fallbacks
- Avoid blocking critical operations
- Provide clear error messages to Claude

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Create a `.claude/hooks` directory in your project
2. Add hook configuration to your Claude Code settings
3. Start with simple logging hooks to understand the flow
4. Gradually add more sophisticated validation and learning hooks
5. Monitor and refine based on actual usage patterns
