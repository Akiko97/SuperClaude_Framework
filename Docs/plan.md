# SuperClaude MCP Migration Plan

## üéØ Vision & Objectives

**Transform SuperClaude from over-engineered hook system to elegant MCP architecture**
- Replace 15 complex Python hooks with 5 focused MCP servers
- Reduce 505-line settings.json to <100 lines  
- Integrate proven patterns from existing MCP servers
- Maintain performance with hybrid bridge hook architecture
- Enable modular installation and community extensibility

## üìä Architecture Transformation

**BEFORE**: 15 Python Hooks + Complex Orchestration + Fragile Configuration
**AFTER**: 5 MCP Servers + 3 Bridge Hooks + Clean Configuration

### Target MCP Server Suite
1. **superclaude-tasks** - Queue-based task management + AI decomposition
2. **superclaude-orchestrator** - Multi-model coordination + Wave management
3. **superclaude-code** - LSP semantic analysis + Symbol-level editing  
4. **superclaude-quality** - Enhanced validation + Semantic integration
5. **superclaude-performance** - Complexity estimation + Advanced monitoring

### Research Integration
- **Claude Task Master**: Multi-model provider abstraction, PRD parsing
- **MCP TaskManager**: Queue-based workflow, planning/execution phases
- **Task Manager MCP**: AI-driven task decomposition, complexity estimation
- **Serena**: LSP integration, semantic code analysis, symbol editing

## üöÄ 4-Phase Migration Strategy (24 weeks)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-6)
**Deliverables:**
- superclaude-tasks MCP server with queue management + AI decomposition
- Bridge hook system (3 lightweight hooks: dispatcher, performance, context)
- Dual system operation (hooks + MCP running in parallel)

**Key Features:**
- Queue-based task management with persistent task IDs
- AI-powered task decomposition into manageable subtasks
- PRD document parsing into structured tasks
- Bridge hooks for event capture and routing

### Phase 2: Core Capabilities (Weeks 7-14)  
**Deliverables:**
- superclaude-code server with LSP integration
- superclaude-orchestrator with multi-model support
- State synchronization between systems
- Cross-server communication protocols

**Key Features:**
- Semantic code analysis using Language Server Protocol
- Symbol-level code editing capabilities
- Multi-model AI provider abstraction (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
- Wave coordination and compound intelligence synthesis

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 15-20)
**Deliverables:**
- superclaude-quality server with semantic integration
- superclaude-performance server with complexity estimation
- Migration tools and compatibility layers
- Comprehensive testing suite

**Key Features:**
- 8-step quality validation enhanced with semantic analysis
- Performance monitoring with complexity estimation
- Cross-server optimization and caching
- Automated migration tools

### Phase 4: Transition & Cleanup (Weeks 21-24)
**Deliverables:**
- Gradual hook system deprecation
- User migration guides and tooling  
- Documentation and community support
- Final cleanup and optimization

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Bridge Hook Architecture
```python
# superclaude_dispatcher.py - Main event router
class EventDispatcher:
    def pre_tool_use(self, data):
        # Immediate: Performance tracking (<10ms)
        perf_monitor.track_start(data)
        
        # Route to MCP servers (10-100ms)
        if self.is_task_event(data):
            asyncio.create_task(self.route_to_mcp('superclaude-tasks', data))
        
        # Background processing (>100ms)
        if self.needs_quality_check(data):
            self.queue_for_background('superclaude-quality', data)
```

### Configuration Simplification
```json
{
  "superclaude": {
    "mode": "mcp",
    "servers": {
      "tasks": { "enabled": true, "priority": "high" },
      "orchestrator": { "enabled": true, "priority": "critical" },
      "code": { "enabled": false, "priority": "medium" }
    },
    "bridge_hooks": ["dispatcher", "performance", "context"]
  }
}
```

### MCP Server Standards
- TypeScript/Node.js implementation
- Standard MCP protocol compliance
- Health monitoring and metrics
- Orchestrator integration capabilities
- Independent testing and deployment

## üìà Success Metrics & Validation

**Quantitative Targets:**
- Configuration complexity: 505 lines ‚Üí <100 lines (80% reduction)
- Installation time: ~30 minutes ‚Üí <5 minutes (83% improvement)
- Memory usage: Reduced through isolated MCP processes
- Performance: Maintain sub-100ms execution targets

**Quality Gates:**
- >90% test coverage across all servers
- Feature parity validation with existing hooks
- Performance regression testing
- Community adoption: 50% user migration within 3 months

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

**High-Risk Scenarios & Mitigation:**
1. **Performance Degradation** (30% probability)
   - Mitigation: Bridge hooks handle time-critical operations, extensive performance testing
   
2. **Migration Complexity** (60% probability)  
   - Mitigation: Automated tools, 4-week parallel operation, step-by-step guides
   
3. **Integration Failures** (40% probability)
   - Mitigation: Circuit breaker patterns, graceful degradation, 24-hour rollback capability

**Parallel Operation Strategy:**
- Both systems run simultaneously for 4 weeks
- Automated fallback to hooks if MCP servers fail
